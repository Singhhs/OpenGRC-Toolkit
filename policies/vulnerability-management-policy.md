## 1. Purpose

This policy establishes requirements for identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and remediating vulnerabilities in [ORGANIZATION NAME]'s information systems to reduce security risk.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to:
- All servers and endpoints
- Network devices and infrastructure
- Applications (internal and external-facing)
- Databases
- Cloud environments
- Container and container orchestration platforms
- IoT and OT devices

## 3. Policy Statements

### 3.1 Vulnerability Identification

#### 3.1.1 Scanning Requirements

| Asset Type | Scan Type | Frequency |
|------------|-----------|-----------|
| External-facing systems | External vulnerability scan | Weekly |
| Internal servers | Internal vulnerability scan | Monthly |
| Workstations/Endpoints | Agent-based scanning | Continuous |
| Web applications | Web application scan | Monthly |
| Databases | Database vulnerability scan | Quarterly |
| Network devices | Network device scan | Monthly |
| Cloud environments | Cloud security scan | Weekly |

#### 3.1.2 Scanning Coverage

- 100% of known assets in scope
- New assets scanned within 7 days of deployment
- Assets not scanned in 30 days flagged for review

#### 3.1.3 Authenticated Scanning

- Authenticated scans required for accurate assessment
- Scan credentials secured and rotated regularly
- Service accounts used with minimum necessary privileges

### 3.2 Vulnerability Assessment

#### 3.2.1 Severity Classification

Use CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) as baseline:

| Severity | CVSS Score | Description |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| Critical | 9.0 - 10.0 | Immediate threat, likely to be exploited |
| High | 7.0 - 8.9 | Significant risk, exploitation possible |
| Medium | 4.0 - 6.9 | Moderate risk, exploitation less likely |
| Low | 0.1 - 3.9 | Minimal risk, exploitation difficult |
| Informational | N/A | Best practice recommendations |

#### 3.2.2 Risk Prioritization

Adjust priority based on:

| Factor | Impact on Priority |
|--------|-------------------|
| Asset criticality | Critical assets = higher priority |
| Data sensitivity | Sensitive data = higher priority |
| Network exposure | Internet-facing = higher priority |
| Exploit availability | Public exploit = higher priority |
| Active exploitation | Being exploited = immediate priority |
| Compensating controls | May reduce priority |

### 3.3 Remediation Requirements

#### 3.3.1 Remediation Timeframes

| Severity | Internet-Facing | Internal | Exceptions |
|----------|----------------|----------|------------|
| Critical | 7 days | 14 days | CISO approval |
| High | 14 days | 30 days | Security Manager approval |
| Medium | 30 days | 60 days | IT Manager approval |
| Low | 90 days | 90 days | Document in risk register |
| Informational | Best effort | Best effort | N/A |

<!-- CUSTOMIZE: Adjust timeframes based on your organization's risk tolerance -->

#### 3.3.2 Expedited Remediation

Expedited remediation required when:
- Active exploitation in the wild
- Wormable vulnerability
- Critical systems affected
- Regulatory requirements

#### 3.3.3 Remediation Options

| Option | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| Patch | Primary option, vendor-supplied fix |
| Upgrade | When patching not possible |
| Configuration change | When vendor fix not available |
| Compensating control | Temporary mitigation |
| Isolation | When other options not available |
| Decommission | End-of-life systems |
| Accept | With documented approval |

### 3.4 Patch Management

#### 3.4.1 Patch Classification

| Category | Testing Required | Deployment Window |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Emergency (zero-day) | Minimal | Immediate to 24 hours |
| Security Critical | Standard test | Within SLA |
| Security Important | Standard test | Within SLA |
| Non-Security | Extended test | Monthly cycle |

#### 3.4.2 Patch Testing

- Test patches in non-production environment
- Verify no adverse impact
- Document test results
- Emergency patches may have reduced testing

#### 3.4.3 Patch Deployment

- Follow change management process
- Deploy during maintenance windows when possible
- Verify successful installation
- Monitor for issues post-deployment

### 3.5 Exceptions and Risk Acceptance

#### 3.5.1 Exception Process

When remediation cannot meet SLA:

1. Document business justification
2. Identify compensating controls
3. Determine residual risk
4. Obtain appropriate approval
5. Set review date

#### 3.5.2 Approval Authority

| Severity | Approval Required |
|----------|------------------|
| Critical | CISO + Executive |
| High | CISO |
| Medium | IT Security Manager |
| Low | IT Manager |

#### 3.5.3 Exception Documentation

Exceptions must document:
- Vulnerability details
- Affected systems
- Business justification
- Compensating controls
- Residual risk
- Review/expiry date
- Approvals

### 3.6 Reporting and Metrics

#### 3.6.1 Key Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Time to remediate Critical | < 7 days |
| Time to remediate High | < 14 days |
| Open Critical/High vulnerabilities | < [X] |
| Asset scan coverage | > 95% |
| Patch compliance rate | > 90% |
| Vulnerability aging | Trend downward |

#### 3.6.2 Reporting

| Report | Frequency | Audience |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| Vulnerability Status | Weekly | IT Security |
| Executive Summary | Monthly | Executive/CISO |
| Trend Analysis | Quarterly | IT Leadership |
| Compliance Report | Per requirement | Auditors |

### 3.7 Threat Intelligence

- Monitor threat intelligence feeds
- Prioritize vulnerabilities with active exploits
- Subscribe to vendor security advisories
- Participate in information sharing groups

## 4. Roles and Responsibilities

### 4.1 IT Security
- Manage vulnerability scanning program
- Analyze and prioritize vulnerabilities
- Track remediation progress
