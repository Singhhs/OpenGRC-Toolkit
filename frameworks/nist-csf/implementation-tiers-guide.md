## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 What Are Implementation Tiers?

Implementation Tiers describe the degree to which an organization's cybersecurity risk management practices exhibit characteristics defined in the Framework. Tiers range from Partial (Tier 1) to Adaptive (Tier 4).

### 1.2 Purpose of Tiers

Tiers help organizations:
- **Understand current state** - Assess where they are now
- **Set targets** - Define where they want to be
- **Communicate** - Discuss cybersecurity posture with stakeholders
- **Prioritize** - Focus resources on meaningful improvements
- **Measure progress** - Track improvement over time

### 1.3 Important Considerations

| Consideration | Explanation |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Not a maturity model** | Tiers measure risk management, not capability level |
| **Context matters** | Higher tier isn't always better for all organizations |
| **Cost-benefit** | Progression should be based on risk analysis |
| **Partial achievement** | An organization may be at different tiers for different categories |

## 2. Tier Definitions

### 2.1 Overview

| Tier | Name | Summary |
|------|------|---------|
| **Tier 1** | Partial | Ad hoc, reactive |
| **Tier 2** | Risk Informed | Risk-aware, not organization-wide |
| **Tier 3** | Repeatable | Formal, consistent |
| **Tier 4** | Adaptive | Continuous improvement |

### 2.2 Tier Dimensions

Each tier is evaluated across three dimensions:

| Dimension | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Risk Management Process** | How cybersecurity risk management is practiced |
| **Integrated Risk Management Program** | How cybersecurity integrates with the organization |
| **External Participation** | Engagement with the broader ecosystem |
