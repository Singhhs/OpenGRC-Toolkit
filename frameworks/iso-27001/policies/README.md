## Required vs. Recommended

### Required by ISO 27001

The standard explicitly requires:
- Information Security Policy (Clause 5.2)
- Risk assessment and treatment processes (Clause 6.1)
- Statement of Applicability

### Recommended for Implementation

Supporting policies to address specific control areas make implementation and compliance more manageable.
